In order to run the code, navigate to the newmath folder. 

 - newmath_java for java code
 - newmath_ex for elixir code

once there in the terminal, execute these commands:

 % ./bin/run    # to run the newmath program
 % ./bin/test   # to test the newmath program


if using the elixir code, you will be prompted to enter another command. 
 
 % Newmath.div(x,y)   # where x is the numerator and y is the denominator
